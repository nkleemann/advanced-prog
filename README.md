# Adanced Programs

Collection of notes and programs on functional programming with Haskell.

Some are my solutions for the lecture "4010 - Fortgeschrittene Programmierung (Prof. J. Waldmann)"
(engl: "Advanced Programming"), others are excerpts of programs that I wrote or just programs I wrote for learning a new topic.
